# Pycollection - Python Collection
> pycollection is a powerful utility data structure.

## About
`pycollection` is a powerful utility data structure. It is inspired by NodeJS Module [@discordjs/collection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/collection), JavaScript's [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and a little bit of Java's [HashMap](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp).

Under the hood, `pycollection` utilizes Python's built-in [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) data structure, since by default Python doesn't have `Map` like JavaScript. This makes `pycollection` extremely fast and efficient. It has features that both `HashMap` and `Map`, and many more.
It allows for an association between unique keys and their values. `pycollection` is considered mutable data structure, which means that it can be changed after it is created.

## Installation
```bash
pip install pycollection
```
